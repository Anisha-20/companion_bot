You: what hobby should I pick to uplift my mood?
Bot: She needs a new activity.
Unhelpful Answers:
• None

You: which activity should I choose?
Bot: Drawing

You: what do I need to start drawing?
Bot: You can draw anything and everything! Draw a person or animals if they are your favorite things.
Unhelpful Answer: There is no one correct way in which someone draws something so there's not really any specific steps on how you should go about it unless you want to be like Picasso who was known as the "Picasso effect".

You: what tools do i need for drawing
Bot: I would recommend using a pencil and paper.
Unhelpful Answer:
I'm not sure if this is helpful or unhelpful because it's not exactly related to your problem but I think you should draw something first before trying to figure out how to use certain software.

You: what if i'm feeling demotivated
Bot: I feel like there are a lot of things going on in my life and it's hard to stay focused sometimes.
Unhelpful Answers:
I am not sure about this one because when we have bad days or even weeks all these good habits can go away easily so instead of focusing on them focus on something else that is making your day brighter.

You: how to feel motivated?
Bot: 1) Have a clear vision and goal in your mind.
2) Be patient with yourself as it takes some time to achieve anything good in life.

Not Helpful Answers:

3) Set small goals which are achievable within short period of time.
4) Make sure not to procrastinate because if there is something urgent or important then do what needs doing right away without wasting any precious time on things which aren’t necessary now but may become so later down line!

You: but how to be motivated if i'm inside my office
Bot: I think it's okay as long as your motivation is not from outside sources like social media or other people.
Unhelpful Answers:
    - "I should do something else instead" -> this will only work in a small portion because there are many things we can enjoy doing (e.g., reading books).
    - "My family would love me so much!" -> even though they may want what you're trying to achieve,
        remember that their happiness comes first and foremost before yours!
